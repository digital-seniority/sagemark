/**
 * Request tenancy context + the mockable data-access seam (PR 005, lane
 * engine-port).
 *
 * THE TENANCY CHOKEPOINT. Every `/content/api/*` call is keyed to exactly one
 * `(workspaceId, clientId)` (criterion 7), and that binding is derived HERE —
 * never trusted from request input. The flow:
 *
 *   1. `bindRequestContext` resolves the operator's workspace from the auth seam
 *      (`apps/seo/src/lib/auth.ts`, DR-003) — the SERVER's notion of "who", not
 *      anything the caller sent.
 *   2. It validates that `clientId` belongs to THAT workspace (the layer-3
 *      workspace_id -> client_id tenancy bridge). A forged/foreign client id
 *      resolves to NOT_OWNED (the route returns 404 — no existence leak).
 *   3. Any route that ALSO receives a request-supplied `workspace_id`/`client_id`
 *      (draft) calls `assertTenancyMatch` to reject a mismatch with a 403
 *      (criterion 2) — request tenancy is checked against the bound context,
 *      never used to widen it.
 *
 * MOCKABLE DATA ACCESS. sagemark has no live Supabase wired (DR-006). The routes
 * talk to the DB ONLY through the `ContentDataAccess` seam, so:
 *   - tests inject a fixture/spy implementation (assert "no DB write" in the
 *     audit read-only test; inject tenancy + voice-spec + piece fixtures);
 *   - the production default is a fail-closed stub that throws a clear
 *     "data access not wired" error rather than silently succeeding.
 *
 * The seam exposes a `writes` counter the audit-read-only test asserts stays at
 * zero — the structural proof that audit cannot mutate.
 *
 * Clean ASCII / UTF-8. No `server-only` marker (imported by plain-Node tests).
